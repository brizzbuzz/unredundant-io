[Ktor](https://ktor.io/) has long been one of my favorite web frameworks. It's concise DSL,
asynchronous design, and powerful plugin architecture makes it an awesome choice for building
your next microservice.

Unfortunately, it does not offer OpenAPI generation out of the box. This means devs are left to
hand roll their own documentation, often leading to stale documentation at best, and no documentation
at worst. Since undocumented APIs are about as useful as non-existent APIs, I believe that Ktor needs
a documentation generator that is as awesome as the framework is itself.

The team has long said that OpenAPI support is on their roadmap
(most recently [here](https://blog.jetbrains.com/ktor/2022/02/11/ktor-roadmap-what-s-next/)),
however, it seems a bit crazy how long it has taken, so I decided to go ahead and build my own.
This is why I created [Kompendium](https://github.com/bkbnio/kompendium).

# Getting Started with Kompendium

The easiest way to give Kompendium a test run is to use the GitHub template that I created [here](https://github.com/bkbnio/sourdough-kt).

This will give you a minimal (but fully documented) API out-of-the-box. Simply clone to your local machine and run the following

1. `docker compose up -d` This will launch the database that the dummy app uses under the hood
2. `./gradlew api:run` This will launch the API on port `8080`

Once you have done those two things, go ahead and navigate to `localhost:8080/docs`. You should see an API documentation page

## But How?

Great question! It's pretty simply, actually. Because of Ktor's [plugin architecture](https://ktor.io/docs/custom-plugins.html)
we are able to define custom plugins that extend the functionality of the framework.

### Installing the Application Plugin

To install Kompendium, users need to install the `NotarizedApplication` plugin to their server.

The example code can be found [here](https://github.com/bkbnio/sourdough-kt/blob/fc9e8b74e6785edfe71a94dc49613ed91e01f162/api/src/main/kotlin/io/bkbn/sourdough/api/Api.kt)

```kotlin
fun main() {
  embeddedServer(
    CIO,
    port = 8080,
    module = Application::mainModule
  ).start(wait = true)
}

private fun Application.mainModule() {
  // install other plugins
  install(NotarizedApplication()) {
    spec = OpenApiSpec(
      info = Info(
        title = "Sourdough API",
        version = "0.0.1",
        description = "A Delicious Starter API",
        termsOfService = URI("https://example.com"),
        contact = Contact(
          name = "Homer Simpson",
          email = "chunkylover53@aol.com",
          url = URI("https://gph.is/1NPUDiM")
        ),
        license = License(
          name = "MIT",
          url = URI("https://github.com/bkbnio/kompendium/blob/main/LICENSE")
        )
      ),
      servers = mutableListOf(
        Server(
          url = URI("http://localhost:8080"),
          description = "Developer instance"
        ),
      )
    )
  }
  // setup routes here
}
```

This gives us the baseline [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) spec metadata that we need in order for our documentation to start
to take form. It also installs the necessary state in our Ktor application for further use. This comes in handy for our next step

### Providing Route Level Documentation

To actually document our individual routes, we must install the `NotarizedRoute` plugin on the routes we wish to document.

Let's say we want to write and document a simple health check endpoint. We could define a `HealthCheckController` object
that exposes a single method `healthCheckHandler`

```kotlin
object HealthCheckController {
  fun Route.healthCheckHandler() {
    route("/") {
      documentation()
      get {
        call.respond(status = HttpStatusCode.OK, HealthCheckModels.Status())
      }
    }
  }

  private fun Route.documentation() {
    install(NotarizedRoute()) {
      tags = setOf("Util")
      get = GetInfo.builder {
        summary("Health Check")
        description("Used predominantly for automated health checks")
        response {
          responseCode(HttpStatusCode.OK)
          responseType<HealthCheckModels.Status>()
          description("Indicates that server is up and running")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see, all we need to do is execute our `documentation` function on the route itself, and Kompendium will wire
the documentation code into the applications state, ready for us to view as an end user.

### Documenting Authentication

When we want to document that and endpoint is secured behind an authentication mechanism, we must do two things

1. Document the auth mechanism at the application level
2. Associate the route with the appropriate mechanism(s)

Doing the first part is trivial

```kotlin
private fun Application.mainModule() {
  // install other plugins
  install(NotarizedApplication()) {
    // baseSpec here is the same spec we defined above
    spec = baseSpec().copy(
      components = Components(
        securitySchemes = mutableMapOf(
          "basic" to BasicAuth()
        )
      )
    )
  }
  // setup routes here
}
```

Once we have defined our security schema(s), we can associate our routes to them

```kotlin
private fun Route.authenticatedDocumentation() {
  install(NotarizedRoute()) {
    parameters = listOf(
      Parameter(
        name = "id",
        `in` = Parameter.Location.path,
        schema = TypeDefinition.STRING
      )
    )
    get = GetInfo.builder {
      summary("Get user by id")
      description("A very neat endpoint!")
      // Will display that our route is secured via basic auth
      security = mapOf(
        "basic" to emptyList()
      )
      response {
        responseCode(HttpStatusCode.OK)
        responseType<ExampleResponse>()
        description("Will return whether or not the user is real üò±")
      }
    }
  }
}

```

The `emptyList()` here can be a bit confusing. This corresponds to a collection of `scopes` for the authentication mechanism.
This really only applies to OAuth and API Key auth mechanisms, so for trivial implementations like basic auth, we provide an empty list

### Documenting Exceptions

As much as we'd all love our code to work flawlessly, _occasionally_, things don't work out quite like
we planned. Luckily, Ktor is ready for this scenario with their [StatusPage](https://ktor.io/docs/status-pages.html) plugin.

This allows us to define API behavior for when our code throws exceptions. But how to document this?

Luckily, Kompendium has you covered ‚ù§Ô∏è

We can document that our route can provide alternative responses using the `canRespond` method

```kotlin
private fun Route.locationDocumentation() {
  install(NotarizedRoute()) {
    parameters = listOf(
      Parameter(
        name = "id",
        `in` = Parameter.Location.path,
        schema = TypeDefinition.STRING
      )
    )
    get = GetInfo.builder {
      summary("Get user by id")
      description("A very neat endpoint!")
      response {
        responseCode(HttpStatusCode.OK)
        responseType<ExampleResponse>()
        description("Will return whether or not the user is real üò±")
      }
      // Informs our API users that this is a potential response
      canRespond {
        description("Bad Things Happened")
        responseCode(HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError)
        responseType<ExceptionResponse>()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## What's Next?

Kompendium is still pretty raw. It's test suite is pretty epic (topic for another post), but there are likely several
edge cases that are not covered. If you run into any problems using Kompendium, please open a GitHub issue
