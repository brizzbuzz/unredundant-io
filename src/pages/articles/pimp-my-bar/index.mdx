Different kind of blog post today, on a rather anodyne subject. The macOS status bar!

Yep, that snooze-worthy top level of your Mac that you likely only both with when the Wi-Fi isn't working.

But I'm here to tell you that it can be more... Much more! I'll introduce you to two of my favorite macOS apps that
have completely redefined my thoughts on the status bar, [Raycast](https://raycast.com) and [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/Bartender4/).

# Raycast

At its core, Raycast is actually a utility launcher. Meant as a drop-in replacement for your Mac's standard command
launcher, it provides turbocharged functionality and has a store full of useful plugins that offer extended functionality.

I highly recommend it in general, but the feature that is the focus of this article is their [Menu Bar Commands](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/menu-bar-commands).

Currently in beta, this allows plugin developers to create custom menu bar displays, useful for all sorts of things.

Think GitHub notifications, pomodoro timer status, etc. etc. Anything that you may want to actively track the status
of at a glance.

However, a problem quickly arises as you dig into this feature. Real estate is _very_ limited. Just a few additional
menu bar items, on top of whatever else maybe be in your tray from installed applications, and suddenly you are overflowing
the allotted space.

MacOS doesn't handle this particularly gracefully as far as I can tell, it kinda just drops things off the edge, something
you certainly don't want with your snazzy, just added menu bar commands!

This is where Bartender comes in

# Bartender

[Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) is an app that "lets you take control of your menu bar". It's awesome. It's
not free, I believe a license is $16, and worth every penny. Now, I can curate exactly what shows up in my status bar,
including any Raycast extensions!

Anything else goes to the bartender overflow, which is activated by hovering on the menu bar
