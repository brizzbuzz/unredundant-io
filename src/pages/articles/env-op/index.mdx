My second anodyne topic in as many weeks. I really need to spice up my life.

Until then, let's talk environment variables

## Helpless Grandmas

Currently, developers collectively have decided to just accept an absolutely mental approach to storing sensitive credentials we use for local development,
which is to simply store them as plain text scattered around our machines.

Stopping and thinking about this for even a second exposes us as security frauds, just a bunch of hapless little grandma's who store their passwords in Notepad, except worse, because we at least, should know better.

We can do better. Honestly, we must do better. Thankfully, we can borrow from cloud security principles to harden our local environment, and improve the developer experience in the process.

## Proposed Solution

When deploying software to the cloud, it is a common practice to inject secrets at runtime from a centralized secret store. This way, we focus deeply
on hardening our central store, restricting access using fine-grained access controls.

What if our local environments could operate in a similar manner?

Rather than having developers maintain exhaustive instructions on configuring local environment variables, we instead maintain a centralized
source of truth for local secrets.

### Introduce 1Password & CLI

Thankfully, a mechanism for maintaining local secrets is pretty much a solved problem.  Password managers have been around for over a decade now,
and if you're not already using one, you _really_ should be.  I'll leave it to [1Password](https://blog.1password.com/why-you-need-a-password-manager/)
to convince you.

What has not been so easy, historically speaking, is accessing these secrets in a programmatic fashion.  Enter the [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/).

This allows developers to access their secrets in a secure fashion, through their terminal (and by proxy, really any application that can access the shell).

## A Simple Example

The easiest way to see how much better this is than the old approach is to see a working example.  In the 1Password ecosystem, secrets are segmented by what they call vaults.

Every user has a private vault that only they can access, along with an arbitrary number of shared vaults.  This fits perfectly with our needs, as typically local secrets are broken into two categories

1. Secrets that every developer shares (perhaps an api key to a shared resource)
2. Secrets that are unique to every developer (in this example we will use a GitHub personal access token)

### Setting up our vaults

As mentioned above, every 1Password account starts out with a private vault.
In order to follow along, go ahead and make a `Team` vault to store your shared secrets in.
I'll leave it to you to follow the [official documentation](https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults) on creating shared vaults.

Once we've taken care of that, we are ready to create some secrets.  For the purpose of this demo, let's first make a simple entry in our `Private` vault with the following values

<CaptionedImage src={privateVaultExample} caption="Personally, I like to segment my secrets using sections (GitHub in this example)" />

Now, let's go ahead and add an entry to our `Team` vault with some credentials we plan to share across the team.  In my case, I'm adding two dummy encryption keys

<CaptionedImage src={teamVaultExample} />

### Accessing via Terminal

Again I will refer you to the [official documentation](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/) for setting up the 1Password CLI.
I also highly recommend turning on biometric auth, because it is freakin' sweet to inject secrets into your terminal with the touch of a finger.

<CaptionedImage src={drawTheFuckingOwl} caption="My tutorials in a nutshell" />

After you've completed the fucking owl, you'll be able to programmatically access your secrets!

Values are accessed via a file-access syntax

```shell
op read op://{{Vault}}/{{Entry}}/{{Section}}/{{Key}}
```

We can wrap these calls in a shell script to hydrate all of our secrets at once in a simple shell script

```shell
export GITHUB_ACTOR=$(op read op://Private/local.env/GitHub/username)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(op read op://Private/local.env/GitHub/access_token)
export AES_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(op read op://Team/local.env/Encryption/aes_key)
export JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(op read op://Team/local.env/Encryption/jwt_key)
```


## Automatically injecting with direnv

In order to take our next level setup to even higher heights, we need a way to check our environment configuration in to our version control, and have it automatically run whenever a developer enters the directory.
There are a couple tools in this space, my personal favorite being [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

Direnv allows us to automatically source a script (`.envrc`) when we enter a directory or any of its children.  It will also unload the configuration if we leave the directory.  Taking our example from above, we can now
check the following into our source code as the `.envrc` file.

```shell
export GITHUB_ACTOR=$(op read op://Private/local.env/GitHub/username)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(op read op://Private/local.env/GitHub/access_token)
export AES_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(op read op://Team/local.env/Encryption/aes_key)
export JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(op read op://Team/local.env/Encryption/jwt_key)
```

Since it does not directly contain any secrets, it is completely safe to store in version control.

Additionally, whenever a developer checks out a branch, at best, they will automatically have their environment variables perfectly configure.
At worst, they will be warned upon entering the directory if they need to configure any additional environment variables in their private vault.
No more mysterious failures due to missing env variables!

## Conclusion

We did a fair amount here.  We first repented for our collective security sins.
We centralized our secrets into two 1Password vaults, a private one and a shared one for team access.
Then, we configured our terminal to enable programmatic access to our secrets.
Finally, we hooked up direnv, allowing us to place our environment variable configurations into source control.

### The Awesome

The awesome stuff here is fairly obvious.  We no longer have insecure credentials plastered all throughout our development machines.
We can now check our configurations into version control, allowing changes to automatically propagate to all team members.  We not only
improved our security, we did so in a way that provides a dramatically improved developer experience.  This is quite a rare thing

### The Painful

That isn't to say that this solution is perfect.  As it currently stands, each request via the 1Password CLI is performed sequentially.
This means that the more secrets you need to source, the slower it will be to run direnv.  In my personal experience, it makes entering
the directory feel noticeably slower, but not deal-breaking slow.

With that said, I really hope 1Password offers a way to improve this situation.  Something like SQL for 1Password (OQL???) would be amazing.
If you could write a single query to retrieve all of your needed credentials, you could send out a request to your local 1Password agent and
allow it to parallelize the requests in the background.  This would hypothetically make this setup blazing fast.  Let's keep our fingers crossed
that this is something the 1Password team cooks up in the near future.

Till next time ðŸ«¡
