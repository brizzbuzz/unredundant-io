My second anodyne topic in as many weeks. I really need to spice up my life.

Until then, let's talk environment variables

## Helpless Grandmas

Currently, developers collectively have decided to just accept an absolutely mental approach to storing sensitive credentials we use for local development,
which is to simply store them as plain text scattered around our machines.

Stopping and thinking about this for even a second exposes us as security frauds, just a bunch of hapless little grandma's who store their passwords in Notepad, except worse, because we at least, should know better.

We can do better. Honestly, we must do better. Thankfully, we can borrow from cloud security best principles to harden our local environment, and improve the developer experience in the process.

## Proposed Solution

When deploying software to the cloud, it is a common practice to inject secrets at runtime from a centralized secret store. This way, we focus deeply
on hardening our central store, restricting access using fine-grained access controls.
