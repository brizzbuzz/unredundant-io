Tons of cool stuff is going to happen here!

### This is a Markdown subheading

We just used a `###` subheading in our blog post.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    const doStuff = () => {
      return console.log('hey')
    }
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

// this is a code block const doSomething = () => { return console.log('hey') }
